        Welcome to my personal website for a course on
        <em>Creating Web Experiences for the Digital Humanities</em> at the
        University of Vienna!

      <p>
        Github Copilot suggests that I am a Data Scientist who is passionate
        about AI and Machine Learning and currently working as a Data Scientist
        at a tech company in Berlin. None of this applies to me. Iâ€˜m studying
        Digital Humanities and work as a web developer in Vienna.

        However, I have experimented a bit with Generative AI in the previous
        semester. The AI generated image you can see on this page was supposed
        to illustrate a user getting information about a cultural artifact from
        a chatbot.
